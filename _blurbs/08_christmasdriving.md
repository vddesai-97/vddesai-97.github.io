Driving through the rural mountains. It’s Christmas Day. The kids are all out enjoying the nice weather and playing around. They also all seem to be waving at us. Naturally, we wave back. Quickly we realize they are waving at all the cars and that the local taxis are honking back at them. Our honks don’t sound as friendly so we continue waving back. But…the kids slowly stop waving and their faces contort into confusion…it seems waving back is too weird of a concept, especially with our very odd-looking van. But not waving back seems more rude, so we keep waving anyway.
