title: Riding with Arya
order: 4

Arya likes to get really excited as we approach our next stop and that would be cute except for the fact that Clark and I need to focus on the road a little more. And you know how when you are trying to listen to directions or focus extra hard on the road, so you turn the radio down because well I believe that when one sensory is in overdrive we try to dim our other senses. Well you can’t really mute Arya’s whining and pacing so it’s just all very overwhelming while trying to keep an eye our for shaded topes and watch out for the upcoming turn and hear the warnings we are each outputting.
