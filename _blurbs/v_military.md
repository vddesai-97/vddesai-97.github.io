All the military and police. It’s jarring a little. They’re all standing in these pickup trucks but not a pickup truck. You know? When I say a pickup truck, I typically think of a ratty but reliable truck. Nowadays though, pickups trucks are all beefed up. It’s a sad departure in my opinion from what a pickup truck should be. Anyways, these officers will stand all geared up with their rifle and wear a mask over their face which makes them look even more intimidating. The mask is solely for their protection from the dust though. They are standing with their guns in the back of the truck, ready to go. It's a very imposing image.
