Drivers here have a habit of flashing you to warn you to be cautious for something. At first, it was very disorienting. Like are we doing something wrong, is this the wrong road, is there a checkpoint, a fight, what is happening?! Half of the time it’s been that there’s traffic or people walking on the road. The other half is because it’s night and we are driving with our lights on and we’ve pissed them off. Why? Because the previous owners put in the brightest headlights they possibly could, so there’s no difference in brightness if we use our brights or if we have our headlights on. There’s also no medium ground between between lights on and lights off.
