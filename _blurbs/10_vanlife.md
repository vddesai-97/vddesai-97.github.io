Can you believe that we have been on the road for only three months? We’re in Guatemala and this life feels so normal and like this is what we have been doing forever. Our life in Cary feels like such a long time ago. Sure there are days where its hard and miserable and just like what the heck are we doing. But the longer we are on the road, the more this feels natural. Not a dream. Not an adventure. But our life. And yes today, when I am writing this, it’s a good day. We are sitting outside our car, in a grassy area in the middle of Antigua with friends, drinking our coffee and enjoying the morning. It’s a bliss day.
