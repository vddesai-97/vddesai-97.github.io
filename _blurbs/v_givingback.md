My natural inclination is to always give someone something tasty. Sometimes for no reason, like if we are passing them on the road, and sometimes when they show kindness for helping us fill our water tanks or chasing us down to let us know that our bumper is half off. I always worry though that it could come up as rude especially because  unlike when I have a large kitchen, I don’t have many tasty things to share that are homemade or substantial enough for an actual giving of it.
