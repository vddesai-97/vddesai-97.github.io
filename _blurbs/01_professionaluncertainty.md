There’s this form you fill out when applying for some grants where you write down all your collaborators, professional relationships, and what your students that you have mentored are now doing. It’s weird to think about what my advisor is going to write: *Vrinda D. Desai, graduated in 2023, not affiliated...N/A.* 

Now, I consider myself to be a kind of ambitious person who wants to go out and do great things and make an impact on this world. But when I consider this trip, I may not make an impact on the world…but maybe I’ll make an impact on me.
