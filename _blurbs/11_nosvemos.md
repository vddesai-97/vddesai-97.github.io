<em>Nos vemos pronto</em>. See you soon. The idea that there’s a small chance, whether through plans or by accident, you will run into each other again. That through the infinite places and times along this journey, you will be able to reconnect with these people that have become friends. Despite different routes, different paces, and different goals, the hope is that that small chance comes true, even if it is just for one evening.
