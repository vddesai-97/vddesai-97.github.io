We’re about to cross the border and the nerves are high, the shits are shittin, and we’re gonna do it. As we approach the border, we do seem to making stops at ‘American’ staples like McDonald’s and Walmart. The errands list is long and continuously getting added to. Crossing this border is the official start of our #vanlife and we feel utterly unprepared and as if we do not have the items we need to be ready to do this, especially considering our first big stop is Mexico City in a couple of days where we will attempt stealth camping. I think we are just truly nervous to do our first border crossing with a shit-ton of dog food that I think is not allowed across the border, and it would be a sad waste to throw that much out.
