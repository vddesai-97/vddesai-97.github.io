About once a week, we have these days called drerrands days. They sound as awful as they are. These days are days where we are driving a significant distance and have errands to do like supermarket shopping for things like Greek yogurt, plant-based protein, and soy milk, filling up our water tank, and maybe one or two other things. It’s not a lot but it’s takes it toll on us both mentally and physically. To combat this, we have started treating ourselves to some cheap comfort food, such as Sam’s Club pizza. Why you may ask Sam's club pizza? Well most of our past drerrands days has involved a plaza that has Walmart, Sam’s club, autozone, cineapolis, and a couple of other stores all in one plaza which makes doing our errands much easier in the sense it’s a one-stop shop. Anyways, I hope our drerrands days just become regular old errands days in the sense it’s doesn’t take such a heavy mental toll on us.
