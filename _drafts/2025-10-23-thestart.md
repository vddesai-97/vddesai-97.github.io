What the hell happened? Am I right? We were supposed to be in Mexico by June but now it’s mid-October and we are just now crossing the border.

Let me tell you — the journey from June to now hasn’t been pleasant but…it’s had its moments.

I’ll back up a bit though — we didn’t have a camper van plain and simple by May, so we pivoted. We got an emptied out cargo van whose mechanics were sound and slowly but very eagerly (and painfully) started converting it into our home. I thought it was going take us a month, maybe two to do the main conversion, but no. Oh boy, it took us 4 whole darn months to do this with many many obstacles.

This summer was hard, and I’m sure it wasn’t necessary or needed and I definitely didn’t help, as those who know me very well know how I can be. Not only did we have a car that was barely tall enough for Clark, it was also curved all over. Curves do not go well with a first time DIY project. We had to reiterate and reinforce and rebuild structures throughout the entire process.
