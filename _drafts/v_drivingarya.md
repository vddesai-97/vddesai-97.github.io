Arya likes to get really excited as we approach our next stop and that would be cute except for the fact that Clark and I need to focus on the road a little more. And you know how when you are trying to listen to driections or focus extra on the road, you turn the radio down because well I believe that when one sensory is in overdrive we try to mute our other senses. Well you can’t really mute Arya’s whining and pacing so it’s just all very overwhelming while trying to keep an eye our for shaded topezs and watch out for the upcoming turn and hear the warnings we are outputting.
