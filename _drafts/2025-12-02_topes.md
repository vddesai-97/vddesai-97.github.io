American brain 
Highways are for going fast
County roads to travel locally
Stoplights 
(Or better) roundabouts
for traffic 

Mexican roads
Topes
More topes
Definitely just add more topes

Anytime drivers should slow
Whether in town or on the go
Place a tope in the road
And watch the tourists' car implode

It could just be a cross-street
Or a town
A school
Perhaps a place to meet
To walk
To sell

Sometimes labled clearly
Sometimes not
Often placed in the shade
Difficult to spot

Occasionally painted
To make them easier to see
Others the same shade
As the road on which they be

Easier to anticipate 
After some time on the road
Each one an adventure
That might get you towed

Some are wide
And easily passed
Others abrupt
So take your foot off the gas

Our poor bike rack
A casualty 
To these road bumps
Our home on wheels
Tested, but resilient
Has survived the humps

That nothing else has broken
A testament to our construction
But we hold this thought lightly
To not jinx our van's function
