highlight several of the waterways we enjoyed in the state of chiapas
  canon del sumidero
  cascadas  chiflon
  uninjab pools
  lagos de montebello
  
all that water creates lush landscapes
  orchids
  
water also can be too much - touch on northern chiapas floods

and water is sacred. 'el agua es vida.' problem with garbage, runoff, and coca-cola
