The end of 2025. Our last day of this year. We ran errands fruitlessly and what felt like the last minute. We drove back and forth across the town in chaos. We ended in exhaustion. This day was an apt summary of our year. Clark defended his PhD, I wrapped up my postdoctoral research, we packed up our entire life in North Carolina, bought a van, built a home, and started a new adventure with very little rest and too much planning. This was a very busy and taxing year. It is not what I want for our 2026. In honor of this hope, we spent new years doing the things we want to do more of — being outdoors, being partners, and most importantly, being present.
