Our beloved bike rack. Holding two bikes and an inflatable paddle board. Jumping up and down along with the bumps of the road. Especially when one of those hidden speed bumps gets you. Then you see and feel the whole thing jump up in excitement. Well…one such speed bump got it. We hit it so hard, that our bumper half fell off and the bike rack was at a 45 degree angle. Thank god for a kind Samaritan who had just parked his car by that speed bump when we went over it. He saw the whole thing and proceeded to chase us down for 20 minutes to get us to check it out.
