For those of yall who don’t believe in climate change, which I doubt any of you all are since we aren’t friends if you were on of them, be worried about your coffee. Yeah we know about disasters and temperature change, but what about our coffee? 

Clark and I took a coffee tour on a farm in El Salvador. It was just the two of us with it being a weekday and all, which meant we could ask all kinds of questions. As we walked along the machinery and the grounds to store the coffee cherries, wash them, dry them, and sort them in various ways, we heard the challenges that the farm was facing due to a changing climate. The months of November to April are typically the dry months. The months where the coffee beans are left outside in the sun (for free) to dry before roasting. Now though, January/February brings rain, and they heavily rely on weather forecasts to protect the beans. When rain does hit, they have to dry the beans using machines and lots of woods when that happens. One machine is out of commission because it’s from Buffalo, NY and is expensive to repair. The other machines work just fine but use a lot of energy and go slowly. Too slowly to accommodate being used heavily, which is what would be needed if it continues to rain more and more during the dry season. 

Soft matter science — the sorting process is intense at a coffee farm. They initially sort the. cherries by weight using water and a machine so that the lighter cherries float and the heavier cherries sink and exit the machine. These are the cherries we want for coffee. Next after the cherries have been dried with either the first skin left on, or the second skin left on, or no skin leading to various notes, there is even more sorting. The first is a machine that vibrates off the dry skins and the dry skins stay at the top while the beans fall down. Next they vibrate the beans horizontally to sort by size. Last, they vibrate the beans horizontally but with bars and air blowing up to get rid of the empty beans. All sorts of machinery is used to sort the beans by weight and size to get the highest quality, which is only 20% of the entire produce.
