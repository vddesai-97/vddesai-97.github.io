This week was weird. After three months on the road, almost exactly, spending 24 hours together every day, Clark and I seperated for about a week. Let me expand on this. We were doing a workaway at a traditional Guatemalan restaurent named <em>Utz Ki'il</em>. The deal was only for me as you live at the restaurent, which has a small living space that would not be suitable for Arya. We figured Clark would park somewhere in town and I would see him sometime during the day. Turns out this town had little street parking that would have been suitable for our size car. Thankfully, Jacuelyn, the restaurent owner, had a small parking lot up a big hill a 30 minute walk away. Short story long, Clark and Arya ended up parking there and through this arrangement, Clark came and helped out at the restaurent for the day shift before hiking back up to be with Arya. 

During this week, we chopped tons of onions <em>cebollas</em>, carrots <em>zanahorias</em>, green beans <em>ejotes</em>, tomatoes,  and potatoes <em>papas</em> in tiny rhombus like shapes. Clark, who always chops his vegetables bulky, would sometimes have to redo his chopping. I also struggled as well to get it just right. The chopping was intense but needed and these vegetables were used in almost all the dishes. The two main traditionla dishes cooked that week were <em>enstofada</em> and <em>sopa de pepian</em>. The interesting thing though is that while in Mexico, they use spices to flavor their dishes and Mexican dishes are actually known to be <em>picante</em>, this was not true in Guatemala. Yes, we used dried chiles, but that was about it in terms of spice. Spicing was not a thing at all. Salt and oregena were the only two spices to be found in the restaurent. But man oh man, the salsas one could make with the freshest ingredients and nothing else. Let's just say, I watched and I learned, and I am ready to make my own salsas.
