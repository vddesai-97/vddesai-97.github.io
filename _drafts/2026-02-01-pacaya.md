Lede: Our guide with rocks the size of grapefruits ripping through her home

Our visit to pacaya. What brings is dangerous also brings in tourism dollars. We are of course curious as to the intersections of natural disasters and human systems.

Nutgraf:  Warning systems can help alleviate some of the danger to human lives at least.

No deaths from most recent pacaya eruption. Lava and ash flow largely flowed away from towns. Folks evacuated during heaviest activity. https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=342110

Different disasters require different systems, science is different. Some are forecastable, some are not. Many can build on each other

Current efforts (npr article https://www.npr.org/2026/02/10/nx-s1-5544181/extreme-weather-warnings-international), earthquake predictions, landslide and flooding modeling. Hurricane is probably the most famous (perfect for the news cycle, is there an On the Media quote on this?)

Some of this can be made more difficult by climate change, as weather systems may diverge from those studied in the past.

Regardless of predictions, disasters still cause hardship to health and economy. For pacaya, economic hardship thanks to airport closure, tourism closure. Folks did suffer from respiratory issues thanks to ash and residual gases.

We will always be subject to some of the worst that Mother Nature can throw at us. Adaptability and resilience are key. Rebirth will happen too as long as people have enough time to recover

Regardless of how good we can get at predictions and warnings, folks need to heed the biggest warning and work to combat climate change
