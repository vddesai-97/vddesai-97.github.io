This past week was good for me and Clark. I don’t know why and it’s not because we are in a camper van but we have just been struggling to be partners for the last three months. Not all the time but enough that it was becoming tiring and exhaustive and sad. More than all the issues we have gone through in our shared life from working on a van with idealistic expections to family obstacles to sharing a life with another human being. But I think we are getting over this damn hump that is too big and too ugly.
