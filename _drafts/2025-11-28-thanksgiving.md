In American culture (or at least in American advertisements, which can often mirror it), holidays on the beach are shown as having a certain amount of charm; a way of enjoying the time off without the stress of family, presents, and extended travel. This might have appeal to some, but we are not be a part of that group. Our Thanksgiving was spent on the beaches and towns of Mazunte and San Agustinillo on the Pacific Ocean in Oaxaca. The setting was certainly gorgeous; the waves crashed into a series of rocky outcroppings, creating deep bays and picturesque cliffs, caves, and peninsulae. The towns were also charming, with many yoga retreats, art galleries, and local stores dotting the main drag.

It felt a bit empty though. While we enjoyed walking on the beach, reading our books, and watching Arya bound through the waves, we also missed our families. We treated ourselves to some food and drinks throughout the day, but generally found that these paled in comparison to homemade favorites (it didn't help that the vegetarian options were not very exciting either). As a proper Minnesotan, it felt wrong to be sweating through my t-shirt when I should have been bundling up to go for a walk outside. And I never did find anyone to go throw a football with.

While we had a good Thanksgiving, making sure to spend extra time appreciating each other and our adventure, do not count us into the group that would prefer this setting to spending time with our families.
