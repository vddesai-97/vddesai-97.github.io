I am lucky to have a partner like Clark. He’s easy when it comes to dumping the pee in the grass or into the sewer. Taking our waste bag and throwing it in the trash. I, on the other hand, would be too worried about what other people are thinking about what I’m doing. Because it does look a little odd. Our urine diverter is attached to like a solar shower bag, so to dump our pee out, we take the shower bag and the urine divererter, flip it upside down and let that liquid drain out the same way it drained in. And when I say we, I most definitely mean only Clark. Our waste bag is a little different as it’s a compostable plastic bag that’s tied up and could be thrown in the dumpster like any other trash. But it feels weird because you know what it is and maybe the people around you are putting two and two together. Who knows.
