The Canon Sumidero was formed from a large fault about 35 billion years ago. The Grijalva River slowly eroded and deepened this fissure, similar to the Colorado River's work on the Grand Canyon. This deep gorge contains nearly vertical walls of limestone (a type of sedimentary rock), differing from the Grand Canyon, which contains layers of colurful sedimentary, metamorphic, and some igneous rocks.

One of its unqiue feature is the "Christmas Tree" waterfall. This was so cool to see. A waterfall flowing down the canyon walls, minerals were slowly deposited on rocky outcroppings, building them up and becoming a favorite location for moss to grow. Over time, a series of mushroom-like overhangs formed the shape of a Christmas tree on the side of the cliff.
