The Canon Sumidero was formed from a large fault (crack in the Earth's crust) many many years ago (approximaely 35 billion years) and the Grijalva River slowly eroded and deepened this fissure. Similar to the Grand Canyon. This deep gorge contains nearly vertical walls of limestone (a type of sedimentary rock), differing from the Grand Canyon which contains layers of colurful sedimentary, metamorphic, and some igneous rocks.

One of its unqiue feature is the "Christmas Tree" waterfall. I mean, man was this cool to see. It's a waterfall with moss and mineral deposits that form the shape of a Christmas tree on the side of a cliff.
