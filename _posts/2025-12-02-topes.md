American brain <br>
Highways are for going fast <br>
County roads to travel locally<br>
Stoplights <br>
(Or better) roundabouts<br>
for traffic <br>
<br>
Mexican roads<br>
Topes<br>
More topes<br>
Definitely just add more topes<br>
<br>
Anytime drivers should slow<br>
Whether in town or on the go<br>
Place a tope in the road<br>
And watch the tourists' car implode<br>
<br>
It could just be a cross-street<br>
Or a town<br>
A school<br>
Perhaps a place to meet<br>
To walk<br>
To sell<br>
<br>
Sometimes labled clearly<br>
Sometimes not<br>
Often placed in the shade<br>
Difficult to spot<br>
<br>
Occasionally painted<br>
To make them easier to see<br>
Others the same color<br>
As the road on which they be<br>
<br>
Easier to anticipate <br>
After some time on the road<br>
Each one an adventure<br>
That might get you towed<br>
<br>
Some are wide<br>
And easily passed<br>
Others abrupt<br>
So take your foot off the gas<br>
<br>
Our poor bike rack<br>
A casualty <br>
To these road bumps<br>
Our home on wheels<br>
Tested, but resilient<br>
Has survived the humps<br>
<br>
That nothing else has broken<br>
A testament to our construction<br>
But we hold this thought lightly<br>
To not jinx our van's function<br>
