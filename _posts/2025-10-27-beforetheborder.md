We’re about to cross the border and the nerves are high, the shits are shittin, and we’re gonna do it. As we approach the border, we do seem to be making stops at ‘American’ staples like McDonald’s and Walmart for the basics, even though while living in America we almost never went to these places. 

The errands list is long and continuously getting added to. Speakers are broken so we need a small portable bluetooth set to replace it. No propane except for our small measly 1lb, and who knows how much longer that will last (editor's note: we're over a month in and it's still going strong). The water spigot's location is marked but we've driven around this park twice and still can't find it. Nervous to use our tiny, separating toilet except to pee, so rest stops it is for number two. Car insurance for Mexico is unreasonably high, so we hold off on getting one until we get to the border, but that ends up taking half a day. Turns out our pee jug isn't large enough to hold more than 2 pees at a time, so time to find another type of pee bladder before we cross the border and won't know which stores has the highest likelihood of containing anything remotely to what we would need. Speaking of vessels that hold liquid, we forgot to grab the lid to our grey water tank, which is a large 5 gallon commercial jug, so I hope one of these many hotels will be willing to part with a lid to one of their detergent jugs. (It turns out jugs of all sizes are way more common here in Mexico, and this lid could have been easily gotten here.) 

At this point, we aren't sure if we are going to cross this border anytime soon. It is the official start of our #vanlife and we feel utterly unprepared. Clearly. Especially when considering our first big stop is Mexico City in a couple of days, and we will be attempting stealth camping in the largest city in Latin America...it is daunting. 

We are truly nervous to do our first border crossing.
